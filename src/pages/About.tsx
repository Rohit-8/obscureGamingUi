          <ul>
            <li>Play-first: most games are playable without signing in.</li>
            <li>Progressive server features: leaderboards, personalized stats and online
              features become available when the server is connected and you sign in.</li>
            <li>Lightweight UX: compact, responsive UI that runs well on phones and laptops.</li>
            <li>Modular architecture: each game is self-contained to make iteration easy.</li>
          </ul>

            This project uses React + TypeScript and MUI for styling. API calls are proxied
            in development and gated behind a health-check so the UI degrades gracefully when
            server services are still under development.
